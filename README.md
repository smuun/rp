# RP

A simple RPN calculator with `ed`-style input.  A `dc` clone with almost none of `dc`'s functionality.

Why:
- ed and rpn are both unusable, so combining the two is funny
- I was sick of opening Python for simple math
- to practice Rust

# Roadmap

- [ ] arbitrary precision (using `rug`?)
- [ ] rational numbers
- [ ] handle pipes, input file
- [ ] control-l, arrows (capture input without \<Enter\>? pros and cons...)
- [ ] vi-mode for maximum unusability
